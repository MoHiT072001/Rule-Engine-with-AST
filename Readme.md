# RuleEngine

</div>


This repository contains a full-stack project developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) that fetches local weather data from weather API and displays it on the dashboard. Moreover it includes following features as well :-

● Error handling for invalid rule strings or data formats (e.g., missing operators, invalid comparisons).

● Validations for attributes to be part of a catalog.


## Frontend

The frontend is built using Next.js with TypeScript, providing server-side rendering and static site generation. It includes pages for managing rules and visualizing rule evaluations.

Next.js: Handles routing and rendering of components.
TypeScript: Ensures type safety and better development experience.
Styled Components: For styling the application with ease.

## Backend

The backend is developed using Node.js with TypeScript, acting as the core engine for rule evaluation and management. It interacts with the PostgreSQL database using Prisma.

Node.js: Provides a robust and scalable runtime environment.
TypeScript: Ensures type safety and maintainability.
Express.js: Handles API requests and serves the frontend.
Prisma: ORM for PostgreSQL, enabling efficient data querying and management.

## Database

The project uses PostgreSQL for reliable and efficient data storage. Prisma ORM is used to interact with the database, providing a type-safe and intuitive API for database operations.
